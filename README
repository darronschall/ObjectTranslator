ObjectTranslator
=============

ObjectTranslator is a utility class I wrote when ActionScript 3 was brand new.  It converts generic ActionScript 3 objects into class instances.

This code originally comes from a weblog entry in October of 2006, now archived at http://archive.darronschall.com/weblog/2006/10/convert-generic-objects-into-class-instances.html

Usage
-----

Usage is as follows:

  import com.darronschall.examples.vo.Book;
  import com.darronschall.serialization.ObjectTranslator;

  // Define an object with properties that mimic the variable names
  // inside of the Book class
  var bookObj:Object = { title: "My Book title", pageCount: 10, inLibrary: true };

  // Convert the generic object into an instance of the Book class
  var book:Book = ObjectTranslator.objectToInstance( bookObj, Book ) as Book;

Limitations
-----

The code is not yet recursive (feel free to fork and add that!).  If you have nested value objects that you're converting to class instances, you'll have to manually go through the object graph:

  import com.darronschall.examples.vo.Book;
  import com.darronschall.examples.vo.Student;
  import com.darronschall.serialization.ObjectTranslator;

  var studentObj:Object = { firstName: "test first",
  				  lastName: "test last",
					  favoriteBook: { title: "Favorite Book!" }
					};	
								
  // First we need to convert the nested objects to classes
  studentObj.favoriteBook = ObjectTranslator.objectToInstance( studentObj.favoriteBook, Book );
		
  // Convert the student object to a Student class
  var student:Student = ObjectTranslator.objectToInstance( studentObj, Student ) as Student;
